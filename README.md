*** Thoughts about the task ***
The task was very interesting and fun.
This is my first Compose app ever, it was a great opportunity to discover, quickly learn, and get my hands dirty with it. From basic Columns & Rows, to state and recomposition and state hoisting, to animation.
I hope you'll like it :D
