Sync & Build :D

__Thoughts about the task:__ 

The task was very interesting and fun.

This is my first Compose app ever, it was a great opportunity to discover, quickly learn, and get my hands dirty with it. From basic Columns & Rows, to state and recomposition and state hoisting, to animation.

I hope you'll like it :D
